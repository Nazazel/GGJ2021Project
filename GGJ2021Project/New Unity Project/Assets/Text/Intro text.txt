Roe awoke in a cold sweat. Theyâ€™d had an awful nightmare, so they naturally reached for their beloved stuffed animal, Mr. Fluffy Muffins, for comfort. However, no matter how far their wandering arm stretched, Mr. Muffs was nowhere to be felt. Roe unzipped their sleeping bag and searched the surrounding area. A trail of stuffing led them out of their tent and into the shadowy woods beyond. Determined to find their toy, Roe grabbed their flashlight and journeyed into the forest, bracing themselves for the horrors of the unknown. 

What Roe stumbled upon was unlike anything they had ever seen. A behemoth, with hooves spread apart and fanged mouth agape, lay dead and rotting. They brought a hand to their nose; the smell was enough to slay a dozen men. With a passionate cause and flashlight in hand, Roe set on the trail of stuffing, carrying onward into the jaws of the bloated corpse. Roe was on a mission, determined to find Mr. Fluffy Muffins.
